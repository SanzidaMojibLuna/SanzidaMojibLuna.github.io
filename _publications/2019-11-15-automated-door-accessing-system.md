Nowadays IoT plays an integral role to ease the lives of general people and visually impaired people are not an exception. Amongst the many, automated door management system is a primary concern to enhance the home security. Though there is a number of research conducted on automated door access system, a very few of them focuses on integrating all the required features to assist visually impaired people. Therefore, the objective of this research is to develop an automated door accessing system for visually impaired people. In order to attain the objective, this research firstly proposed a conceptual framework to develop an automated door access system. Secondly, a prototype for the proposed system was developed integrating features like visitor authentication using face recognition, voice command, suspicious activity detection using audio alert and recognize harmful objects visitors may carry using object and metal detection. Finally, a light-weighted evaluation study was conducted in a laboratory environment to assess the functional accuracy (effectiveness) of the proposed system. This paper also highlighted the practical and future implications of the proposed system.
