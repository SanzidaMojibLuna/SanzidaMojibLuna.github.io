I am a PhD student in the [Golisano College of Computing and Information Sciences](https://www.rit.edu/computing/) at [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://www.rit.edu/) and a member of the [Niantic x RIT Geo Games and Media Research Lab](https://www.rit.edu/nianticgeogameslab/). 
I am a human-computer interaction researcher focused on designing inclusive, adaptive technologies that prioritize accessibility from the ground up. My work explores how immersive systems like augmented reality (AR) can better support Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) users through participatory design, longitudinal studies, and lightweight AI-driven feedback mechanisms. I aim to bridge technical innovation with ethical design, ensuring that emerging technologies are shaped by — not just adapted for — the diverse realities of their users. I have several published works at prestigious events such as CHI and ASSETS.
